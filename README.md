Overview</br>

For this project, you will create a Monster Game program using classes. The game will create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. The game will include a delay before each life drain.
